# WECOOP
Course project prototype using React.Js

Online prototype is available [here](https://webdev-jeff.github.io/redirectHelper/isom2010.html)


Two accounts available for demo purpose:

* Account 1
  Username & Password: developer

* Account 2
  Username & Password: ideaer

Instruction on this repo: `master` branch is mostly useless. `src` branch stores the development code. `page` branch is the code for deployment. The later two branches are almost the same as the project is now finished.
